How can I roast a roasted almond?
Are you sure you want to ruin your day by typing this sad name?
You are stupider than a worm (has no brain).
He smells worse than rotten garbage.
I pity his name leave this sed creature.
You are more irritating than a buzzing mosquito.
Are you sure someone loves you? They must be faking.
Do not say a word it will be worse than my shit.
Even burnt spiders are prettier than you.
I prefer kissing earthworm than you.
Light travels faster than sound, which is why you seemed bright until you spoke.
I'll never forget the first time we met. But I'll keep trying.
Your face makes onions cry.
You bring everyone so much joy… when you leave the room.
Someday you'll go far… and I really hope you stay there.
You have an entire life to be an idiot. Why not take today off?
Somewhere out there is a tree tirelessly producing oxygen for you. You owe it an apology.
It's scary to think people like you are allowed to vote.
I didn't change. I grew up. You should try it sometime.
Have a nice day, somewhere else.
You look like a 'before' picture.
You need a kiss on the neck from a crocodile.
You are like a cloud. When you disappear it's a beautiful day.
