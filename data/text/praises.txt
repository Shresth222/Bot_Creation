You always make my day.
You are prettier than the beauty of the galaxy.
They say you become star after you die but you are already star.
Please teach me your greatness.
No cosmetic can win against your natural beauty.
You are the world everyone desires.
You are sharper than any blade.
You are richer in quality than bill gates in money.
Your words are rhythm.
I am blinded by your brightness.
You are the richest treasure I ever dug.
Your insides are even more beautiful than your outside.
You're better than a triple-scoop ice cream cone. With sprinkles.
You're even better than a unicorn because you're real.
I would never play hide and seek with you because someone like you is impossible to find.
If you were a fruit, you'd be a â€˜fine-apple.'
If beauty were time, you'd be eternity.
I'd say, 'God bless you,' but it looks like he already did.
Are you HTTP? Because without you, I'm just ://
They say Disneyland is the happiest place on earth. Well apparently, no one has ever been standing next to you.
